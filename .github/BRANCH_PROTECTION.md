# Branch protection — apply after M2-a merges

Branch protection is a GitHub *setting*, not a repo file, so it can't ship in the
workflow itself. Apply the ruleset below to `main` once `ci.yml` has run at least
once (so the check name `ci-required` is registered as selectable).

## Required status check

Required checks (add each as it lands):
- **`ci-required`** — aggregation job in `ci.yml`; green only when every *blocking*
  workspace passes (`docs-website` is non-blocking and cannot fail it).
- **`secret-scan`** — gitleaks (M2-b); blocks on a genuine new secret in the PR range.
- **`hygiene`** — committed-build-artifact guard (M2-b); blocks on tracked generated files.
- **`docker-required`** — Docker build validation aggregation (M2-d); green when all
  changed images build (or none changed). Always runs, so it's deadlock-safe as a
  required check even though the build matrix is path-filtered.
- **`db-required`** — database migration aggregation (M2-c/M4); green only when every
  DB-owning service's migrations are consistent, apply to a fresh Postgres, and carry
  no drift (platform/api Drizzle) / no un-versioned runtime DDL (control-plane). Always
  runs (deadlock-safe).
- **`tests-required`** — money-flow test aggregation (M3); green only when the deposit,
  withdrawal, and SecretStore suites pass against real Testcontainers infra.
- **`dr-drill`** — backup/restore drill (M5); green only when a seeded money database
  can be backed up, destroyed, and restored byte-for-byte.

`dependency-audit` (M2-b) and `drizzle-migrations`' drift step (M2-c) are
**advisory / non-blocking** — do NOT add them as required.

## Option A — GitHub UI
Settings → Rules → Rulesets → New branch ruleset, target `main`:
- ✅ Require a pull request before merging
- ✅ Require status checks to pass → add **`ci-required`**
- ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
- ✅ Block force pushes
- ✅ Restrict deletions
- ✅ Require linear history
- 🔜 Require 1 approving review (enable when the team grows; add CODEOWNERS + dismiss stale approvals then)

## Option B — `gh` CLI (ruleset)
```bash
gh api -X POST repos/Kaushik2003/nordstern/rulesets \
  --input .github/rulesets/main-protection.json
```

The ruleset JSON lives at `.github/rulesets/main-protection.json`.
