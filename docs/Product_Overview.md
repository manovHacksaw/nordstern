The Anchor Platform provides a set of tools and APIs for building on and off-ramp services on the Stellar network. With standardized interfaces and full implementations of key Stellar Ecosystem Proposals (SEPs), it simplifies integration with Stellar-based wallets and exchanges, enabling you to focus on your core business logic rather than protocol implementation details.

## Supported SEPs

The Anchor Platform implements the following Stellar Ecosystem Proposals:

- **[SEP-1](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/platforms/anchor-platform/sep-guide/sep1)** — Stellar.toml file serving for service discovery
- **[SEP-6](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/platforms/anchor-platform/sep-guide/sep6)** — Deposit and withdrawal operations
- **[SEP-10](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/platforms/anchor-platform/sep-guide/sep10)** — Web authentication using challenge/response transactions
- **SEP-12** — Customer KYC/AML data management
- **[SEP-24](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/platforms/anchor-platform/sep-guide/sep24)** — Interactive deposit and withdrawal flows
- **[SEP-31](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/platforms/anchor-platform/sep-guide/sep31/integration)** — Cross-border payment processing (receive only)
- **SEP-38** — Price quotes and exchange rate services
- **[SEP-45](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/platforms/anchor-platform/sep-guide/sep45)** — Web authentication using challenge/responses for contract accounts

## Key Features

- **Complete SEP implementations** — Full support for deposit, withdrawal, and payment processing workflows
- **Authentication & authorization** — SEP-10 and SEP-45 support for both traditional and smart contract accounts
- **Customer management** — SEP-12 integration for KYC/AML compliance and customer data handling
- **Transaction processing** — Comprehensive transaction lifecycle management with status tracking and webhook callbacks
- **Quote & exchange services** — SEP-38 integration for price discovery and exchange rate calculations
- **Multi-asset support** — Flexible configuration for multiple assets with various deposit and withdrawal methods
- **Smart contract support** — Native support for Stellar contract accounts (C-accounts) via SEP-45
