# NordStern — Manual Product Test Plan

> **Master QA checklist before the first public deployment.** Every test here is
> grounded in **code that exists today** (audited 2026-07-09). Where a capability
> is missing, mocked, or read-only, it is marked **N/A (does not exist)** or
> **⚠️ partial** rather than invented — do not treat those as failures; treat them
> as *known scope*.
>
> This document is executed **manually by the founder** on a local environment.
> Nothing here automates a browser, provisions anything, or inspects logs — it is a
> checklist of **what to click and what you should see**.
>
> **Companion:** [`PRODUCT_ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA.md`](./PRODUCT_ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA.md)
> — the subset of these tests that gate the go/no-go deployment decision.

## How to use this document

1. Bring up the environment per **§0 Global setup**.
2. Work top-to-bottom. Each test has a **Result** cell — fill it: `Pass` / `Fail` /
   `Blocked`, and write the issue in the **Issue found** space.
3. A test's **Priority** tells you what blocks deployment:
   - **P0** — must pass before *any* public deploy (money-safety, auth, isolation).
   - **P1** — important; fix before onboarding a real second anchor.
   - **P2** — polish; can trail deployment.
4. When a test references another (e.g. "requires a provisioned anchor from F-30"),
   run the prerequisite first.
5. Anything marked **N/A** is a feature that does not exist yet — skip it, but do
   **not** delete it: it documents scope boundaries a reviewer/investor may ask about.

**Legend:** ✅ works today · ⚠️ partial/known-gap · ❌ / **N/A** not built · 🔒 security-critical

## §0 · Global setup & environment (do this first)

| ID | Pri | Steps | Expected | Result / Issue |
|----|-----|-------|----------|----------------|
| ENV-01 | P0 | Build base images and bring up the connected stack: `docker compose --env-file anchor-service/.env.base -f infrastructure/docker/platform.yml up -d --build` | All services start; no container in `Restarting` | ☐ Pass ☐ Fail — ____ |
| ENV-02 | P0 | `curl -s localhost:4000/health` (platform-api), `localhost:3002/health` (control-plane), `localhost:3005/health` (aggregator) | Each returns healthy JSON (`ok`/`up`) | ☐ Pass ☐ Fail — ____ |
| ENV-03 | P0 | Open platform console `http://localhost:4001` (platform-console container); open Traefik dashboard `http://localhost:8090` | Console landing renders; Traefik dashboard reachable | ☐ Pass ☐ Fail — ____ |
| ENV-04 | P1 | Confirm a real inbox / mail-catcher is reachable for OTP + approval emails (Resend sandbox or console log fallback) | You can retrieve OTP codes and the approval link | ☐ Pass ☐ Fail — ____ |
| ENV-05 | P1 | Confirm the Freighter browser extension is installed on a testnet account (customer Buy/Sell needs wallet signing) | Freighter present, set to **Testnet** | ☐ Pass ☐ Fail — ____ |
| ENV-06 | P2 | Note the admin credential: `ADMIN_USERNAME` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` from the platform-api env | You can log into `/admin/login` | ☐ Pass ☐ Fail — ____ |

> **Auth model reminder (verify you understand before testing):** there are **three
> separate identity realms**, each with its own cookie and **no interchange**:
> **Operator/Founder** = email **OTP** (`ns_access`/`ns_refresh`), **Customer** =
> email **OTP** (`ns_customer`), **NordStern Admin** = a single **username/password**
> demo credential (`ns_admin`). **There are no passwords for founders/operators/
> customers, and no password-reset/email-verification flows** — those are **N/A**.

## §1 · Founder (business applying to become an Anchor)

**Surfaces:** `platform/console` → `/register` (3-step application wizard),
`/login` (OTP), `/redeem` (activation + live provisioning), `/(app)/overview`
(post-launch home), `/(app)/wallet` (SEP sandbox test tool).
**Backend:** `POST /api/v1/applications`, `GET /anchor-invitations/verify`,
`POST /anchor-invitations/redeem`, `GET /anchor-invitations/status/:jobId`, `/retry`.

| ID | Pri | Preconditions | Steps | Expected | Result / Issue |
|----|-----|---------------|-------|----------|----------------|
| F-30 | P0 | Approval link from §2 (A-06) | Open the redeem link; page pre-checks the token (`/verify`) | Token valid → activation form renders with the invited email | ☐ P ☐ F — ____ |

|----|-----|---------------|-------|----------|----------------|
| F-50 | P0 | Force a failure (e.g. stop control-plane mid-provision, or bad creds) | Redeem → provisioning fails | Job status → `failed` with an **error** surfaced; no orphaned "live" claim | ☐ P ☐ F — ____ |

## §2 · NordStern Internal Admin

**Surface:** `platform/console` → `/admin/login`, `/admin` (Anchor applications
review table). **Backend:** `POST /admin/login`, `GET /admin/applications`,
`POST /admin/applications/:id/approve`, `POST /admin/applications/:id/reject`.

| ID | Pri | Preconditions | Steps | Expected | Result / Issue |

| A-09 | P1 | A-06 | Approve the **same** application twice | Second approve is idempotent/blocked — no duplicate live invitation confusion | ☐ P ☐ F — ____ |
| A-10 | P1 | A-01 | Approve several different applications → onboard multiple anchors | Each yields its own invite; multi-anchor onboarding works serially | ☐ P ☐ F — ____ |
| A-11 | P1 | A-01 | Click **Sign out** | `ns_admin` cleared; back to `/admin/login`; table no longer reachable | ☐ P ☐ F — ____ |
| A-12 | P2 | A-05 | With zero applications, view the queue | Honest "No applications yet" empty state | ☐ P ☐ F — ____ |
| A-13 | 🔒 P1 | — | Brute-force `/admin/login` repeatedly | `authLimiter` throttles the demo credential | ☐ P ☐ F — ____ |

> **N/A for the Admin persona (do not test — these do not exist):**
> **Request-changes** transition (only *approve* / *reject* exist), a **document
> viewer** (no KYB upload), and a **Fleet / Health / Monitoring / Logs dashboard**.
> The admin console is an **applications review table only** — there is no
> super-admin fleet view of running anchors. "Provision" and "Retry provisioning"
> are **founder-side** actions (redeem/retry), **not** admin-panel buttons.

## §3 · Anchor Operator (per-anchor console)

**Surface:** `anchor-template/console` at `console-<slug>.anchors.localhost` — screens:
`overview, transactions, customers, treasury, compliance, pricing, api-keys,
webhooks, reports, settings, team, activity, audit, credentials, login`.
**Backend:** business-server `/admin/*` (org-scoped `requireOperator`) + platform-api
`/api/v1/*` proxy. **Auth:** operator email **OTP** (same realm as founder).

> ⚠️ **Before testing §3, read the truthfulness caveats** at the end of this
> section — several endpoints historically fabricated data or shipped demo seeds.
> Part of this pass is **verifying those were de-mocked**. If you see suspiciously
> clean demo rows on a brand-new anchor, that is a **Fail** (FAIL-SEED).

## §4 · Customer (end-user on/off-ramp)

**Surface:** `anchor-template/anchor-client` at `<slug>.anchors.localhost` — screens:
`login, home, buy, sell, verify (KYC), profile, support, transactions, transactions/[id]`.
**Auth:** customer email **OTP** (`ns_customer`). **Money move:** self-custodial —
the customer's **own wallet (Freighter)** signs a "secure confirmation" (SEP-10 under
the hood) to authorise settlement; payment via Razorpay; KYC via DIDIT hosted flow.

## §5 · Multi-tenant isolation (the core white-label claim)

**Goal:** prove that multiple provisioned anchors are fully isolated — brand, data,
sessions, treasury, keys — with **zero cross-tenant leakage**. Traefik routes each
anchor by **Host** (`<slug>.anchors.localhost`); each has its own `anchordb_<slug>`,
keys, and SecretStore refs.

**Setup MT-00 (P0):** provision **four** anchors via the full flow (§2→§1.3):
`mizupay`, `zen`, `orbita`, `nova` — each with a **distinct** name, logo, and theme.

| ID | Pri | Steps | Expected | Result / Issue |
|----|-----|-------|----------|----------------|
| MT-01 | P0 | Open each customer app `<slug>.anchors.localhost` | Each shows its **own** brand name, logo, theme — never another's | ☐ P ☐ F — ____ |
| MT-02 | P0 | Open each operator console `console-<slug>...` | Correct per-anchor branding + data | ☐ P ☐ F — ____ |
| MT-03 | 🔒 P0 | Log into MizuPay operator console; then in the same browser open Zen's console URL | Zen requires its **own** login; MizuPay's session does **not** authorise Zen | ☐ P ☐ F — ____ |
| MT-04 | 🔒 P0 | As MizuPay operator, try to hit Zen's business-server `/admin/*` (via URL/API) | Org-scoped `requireOperator` blocks — no cross-anchor admin data | ☐ P ☐ F — ____ |
| MT-05 | 🔒 P0 | Compare transactions/customers across two anchors | No transaction, customer, or compliance row bleeds between anchors (separate DBs) | ☐ P ☐ F — ____ |
| MT-06 | 🔒 P0 | Compare treasuries | Each anchor has a **distinct** treasury account/float; funds never shared | ☐ P ☐ F — ____ |
| MT-07 | 🔒 P0 | Create an API key in MizuPay; try to use it against Zen | Key is anchor-scoped; rejected by Zen | ☐ P ☐ F — ____ |
| MT-08 | 🔒 P0 | Inspect cookies for two anchor apps open at once | Cookies are host-scoped; a customer signed into MizuPay is **not** signed into Zen | ☐ P ☐ F — ____ |
| MT-09 | P1 | Compare Reports/Settings per anchor | Figures + config reflect only that anchor | ☐ P ☐ F — ____ |
| MT-10 | 🔒 P1 | Inspect each anchor's signing/distribution/issuer keys | Distinct per anchor; encrypted at rest (`anchor_secrets`, AES-GCM); never exposed in UI/API | ☐ P ☐ F — ____ |
| MT-11 | P1 | Set Emergency stop on MizuPay | Only MizuPay Buy is paused; Zen/Orbita/Nova unaffected | ☐ P ☐ F — ____ |
| MT-12 | 🔒 P0 | As a **customer** of MizuPay, try to view Zen customer data / transactions | Fully isolated; no cross-anchor customer leakage | ☐ P ☐ F — ____ |

> ⚠️ **Aggregator seed check (FAIL-SEED-AGG, P1):** `GET localhost:3005/anchors`
> historically seeds demo rows `globex` + `acme` (available=false, fake domains).
> Confirm whether these still appear; they must not be presented as real anchors.

## §6 · Failure, recovery & money-safety scenarios (cross-cutting)

The money-safety guarantees live in `anchor-template/business-server` (Transfer-After-
Commit **outbox** + reconciler for deposits, **at-most-once** withdrawal payout). These
tests prove **money cannot be duplicated or lost** across crashes and retries.

| ID | Pri | Scenario | Steps | Expected | Result / Issue |
|----|-----|----------|-------|----------|----------------|
| FAIL-01 | P0 | Wrong OTP | Enter a bad code on any OTP login | Rejected; no session; retryable (F-15/C-03/A-02) | ☐ P ☐ F — ____ |
| FAIL-02 | P0 | Expired OTP | Use a code after its TTL | Rejected as expired; new code required | ☐ P ☐ F — ____ |
| FAIL-03 | P1 | Network timeout | Kill network mid-quote / mid-submit | Graceful error + retry; no stuck spinner forever | ☐ P ☐ F — ____ |
| FAIL-04 | P1 | Refresh mid-flow | Refresh during Buy processing (C-35) | State recovered from server; no double credit | ☐ P ☐ F — ____ |
| FAIL-05 | P1 | Browser close mid-flow | Close during processing; reopen | Transaction resumes/settles correctly | ☐ P ☐ F — ____ |
| FAIL-06 | 🔒 P0 | **Deposit double-send** | Trigger release, then retry (operator retry O-12, or reconciler) for the same tx | **Exactly one** on-chain transfer — outbox single-winner claim + adopt-existing prevents a second (`releases.ts`) | ☐ P ☐ F — ____ |
| FAIL-07 | 🔒 P0 | **Crash mid-release** | Stop business-server between send and completion; restart | Reconciler resolves: adopts the landed transfer or re-drives a never-landed one — no double-spend, no stuck-forever | ☐ P ☐ F — ____ |
| FAIL-08 | 🔒 P0 | **Withdrawal double-payout** | Re-drive a withdrawal payout | At-most-once guard: no second payout | ☐ P ☐ F — ____ |
| FAIL-09 | P1 | Duplicate application submit | Re-submit the wizard / refresh after submit (F-09/F-10) | No confusing duplicate that breaks the admin queue | ☐ P ☐ F — ____ |
| FAIL-10 | P0 | Double-click pay/confirm | Rapidly double-click the customer confirm/pay | Idempotent — one settlement only (C-37) | ☐ P ☐ F — ____ |
| FAIL-11 | P1 | Wallet disconnected | Disconnect Freighter mid-Buy | Clear prompt to reconnect; no partial state (C-39) | ☐ P ☐ F — ____ |
| FAIL-12 | P1 | Invalid slug | Redeem with a malformed slug (F-35) | Rejected with rules; no half-provision | ☐ P ☐ F — ____ |
| FAIL-13 | 🔒 P0 | Duplicate slug | Redeem two invites for the same slug (F-36) | Second rejected; no container/DB name collision | ☐ P ☐ F — ____ |
| FAIL-14 | P1 | Provisioning timeout | Let a provision hang past health timeout | Job → failed with error; retry available (F-50/51) | ☐ P ☐ F — ____ |
| FAIL-15 | P1 | Service restart | Restart control-plane / aggregator / platform-api individually | Each recovers; running anchors keep serving SEP; record any stalled job (F-53) | ☐ P ☐ F — ____ |
| FAIL-16 | P0 | Payment cancelled | Abandon Razorpay checkout (C-40) | No credit; transaction not falsely completed | ☐ P ☐ F — ____ |
| FAIL-17 | 🔒 P1 | KYC rejected | DIDIT returns reject (C-23) | Buy stays blocked; status honest | ☐ P ☐ F — ____ |
| FAIL-SEED | P1 | Demo-seed check | On a **fresh** anchor, inspect compliance/audit/api-keys/customers | **No** seeded demo rows anywhere (O-40) | ☐ P ☐ F — ____ |

## §7 · Security checks (🔒 manual validation)

| ID | Pri | Area | Steps | Expected | Result / Issue |
|----|-----|------|-------|----------|----------------|
| SEC-01 | 🔒 P0 | Realm isolation | Take an `ns_access` (operator) cookie; call admin + customer routes | Rejected by both — realms never interchange (A-04) | ☐ P ☐ F — ____ |
| SEC-02 | 🔒 P0 | Customer isolation | With an `ns_customer` cookie, call operator `/admin/*` and platform `/organizations/*` | Rejected — customer can't reach operator/admin surfaces | ☐ P ☐ F — ____ |

| SEC-04 | 🔒 P0 | Tenant isolation | Cross-anchor operator + customer probes | Fully blocked (MT-04/05/12) | ☐ P ☐ F — ____ |
| SEC-05 | 🔒 P0 | Cookie scope | Inspect each cookie's Host/SameSite; confirm host-only, not shared across subdomains inappropriately | Cookies scoped so anchor A's session ≠ anchor B (MT-08) | ☐ P ☐ F — ____ |
| SEC-06 | 🔒 P0 | Secret exposure | Grep every API response + page for PSP secrets, signing seeds, plaintext API-key secrets on list | **None** ever exposed (F-34, O-22, O-30, credentials write-only) | ☐ P ☐ F — ____ |
| SEC-07 | 🔒 P0 | URL/API tampering | Change org/anchor/tx/customer/wallet ids in URLs and API calls to another tenant's/user's | Authorization blocks every attempt (IDOR-proof) | ☐ P ☐ F — ____ |

## §8 · UX review (ask these on EVERY screen)

For each surface — Landing, Founder register/redeem/overview, Admin, Operator console
(all modules), Customer app (all screens) — record Yes/No + notes:

| ID | Pri | Question | Result / Notes |
|----|-----|----------|----------------|
| UX-01 | P1 | Can a **first-time fintech founder** understand this screen without help? | ☐ Y ☐ N — ____ |
| UX-02 | P1 | Can a **non-technical customer** understand this screen? | ☐ Y ☐ N — ____ |
| UX-03 | 🔒 P0 | Does anything expose **Stellar / blockchain** terms (USDC, memo, trustline, tx hash, testnet, SEP-24, account G...)? | ☐ None ☐ Leaks — ____ |
| UX-04 | P1 | Does anything expose **developer terminology** (jobId, slug, API paths, JSON)? | ☐ None ☐ Leaks — ____ |
| UX-05 | P1 | Does anything feel **unfinished** (placeholder text, dead buttons, TODO)? | ☐ N ☐ Y — ____ |
| UX-06 | P1 | Any **inconsistency** (spacing, tone, brand colours, button styles)? | ☐ N ☐ Y — ____ |
| UX-07 | P1 | Any **unnecessary friction** (extra clicks, unclear next step)? | ☐ N ☐ Y — ____ |
| UX-08 | 🔒 P0 | Would I **trust this with money**? (clarity of amounts, confirmations, receipts) | ☐ Y ☐ N — ____ |
| UX-09 | P2 | Do **error states** read like a product (not a stack trace)? | ☐ Y ☐ N — ____ |
| UX-10 | P2 | Do **empty states** guide the next action (not just "no data")? | ☐ Y ☐ N — ____ |

**Known jargon-leak hotspots to scrutinise (from `CUSTOMER_MONEY_FLOW_AUDIT`):** the
server-rendered SEP-24 webview historically leaked `USDC`, `memo`, treasury `address`,
`trustline`, `transaction hash`, `testnet`, `SEP-24`. The native customer app should
have replaced these — UX-03 is where you confirm it.

## §9 · Investor demo rehearsal (timeboxed)

**Target: one clean pass in ≤ 12 minutes.** Rehearse until it's muscle memory.

| ID | Pri | Beat | Time | What to show | Result / Issue |
|----|-----|------|------|--------------|----------------|
| DEMO-01 | P0 | Landing | 0:30 | Open the landing site — the positioning ("launch a compliant anchor without building the stack") | ☐ P ☐ F — ____ |
| DEMO-02 | P0 | Founder applies | 1:30 | `/register` 3-step wizard → "Application Submitted" | ☐ P ☐ F — ____ |
| DEMO-03 | P0 | Admin approves | 1:00 | `/admin` → Approve → copy redeem link | ☐ P ☐ F — ____ |
| DEMO-04 | P0 | Activate + provision | 2:30 | `/redeem` → slug/branding/creds → **real** provisioning stages → "Anchor is live" + URLs | ☐ P ☐ F — ____ |
| DEMO-05 | P0 | Anchor is live | 0:30 | Open the fresh customer app + operator console (own brand) | ☐ P ☐ F — ____ |
| DEMO-06 | P0 | Customer buys | 2:30 | Customer OTP → (KYC if needed) → Buy → wallet confirm → Razorpay → **Money added** | ☐ P ☐ F — ____ |
| DEMO-07 | P0 | Settlement visible | 0:30 | Customer receipt + Transactions | ☐ P ☐ F — ____ |
| DEMO-08 | P0 | Operator sees it | 1:00 | Operator console → Transactions shows the customer's deposit; Treasury moved | ☐ P ☐ F — ____ |
| DEMO-09 | P1 | Reports | 0:30 | Operator Reports/Overview rollups | ☐ P ☐ F — ____ |
| DEMO-10 | P1 | Isolation punchline | 1:00 | Show a **second** anchor with different brand + separate data | ☐ P ☐ F — ____ |

### Demo risks (mitigate before presenting)

| Risk | Why it bites | Mitigation |
|------|--------------|------------|
| Provisioning slow/flaky live | Real Docker + Friendbot + health polling can take minutes | Pre-provision a spare anchor; have DEMO-04 as "here's one I prepared" fallback |
| Testnet reset wiped keys/asset | Testnet resets quarterly (DL-003) | Re-run setup before the demo; verify F-39 the morning of |
| OTP email delivery lag | Demo stalls waiting for a code | Use a fast mail-catcher or pre-seed the account; know the log fallback |
| Freighter not on testnet | Buy signature fails | ENV-05 checked; wallet funded via Friendbot |
| Razorpay sandbox hiccup | Payment step stalls | Have test card details ready; know the cancel/retry path |
| Off-ramp looks "fake" | Payout is mock (C-53) | Frame Sell honestly as detection + simulated payout; lead with Buy |
| Demo-seed / fake rows appear | Historic seeds (FAIL-SEED) | Verify O-40 on the demo anchor beforehand |
| Aggregator shows `globex`/`acme` | Seed rows | Confirm FAIL-SEED-AGG; hide or remove before showing the registry |
| Cross-tenant confusion | Two anchors, one browser | Use separate browser profiles/incognito per anchor |

## Appendix A · Explicitly NOT APPLICABLE (features that do not exist)

Do **not** write or expect tests for these — they are documented scope boundaries,
not failures:

- **Passwords / password reset / email verification** for founders, operators, or
  customers — the platform is **OTP-only** (`auth.routes.ts`, `customer.routes.ts`).
- **Application "request changes"** transition — admin has only **approve** / **reject**.
- **KYB / licence document upload & viewer** — no backend (`FOUNDER_ONBOARDING_AUDIT`).
- **Founder application-status / waiting page** — approval is communicated by email.
- **Admin Fleet / Health / Monitoring / Logs dashboard** — the admin console is an
  applications review table only.
- **Live branding/settings editing** in the operator console — branding is set once at
  provision; Settings is read-only (`OPERATOR_CONSOLE_AUDIT` gap 5).
- **CSV/report export endpoint** — Reports are computed client-side; export is disabled.
- **Real fiat off-ramp payout** — Sell payout is **mock** (no live Cashfree creds).
- **Bank balance / reserved / daily-settlement** figures — no bank integration (null).
- **Production TLS / public domain / K8s** — dev runs Traefik `:80` on `.localhost`;
  `anchor-template/infra` (EKS/Helm/ArgoCD) is authored but **not wired to runtime**.

## Appendix B · Known data-truthfulness risks to re-verify (were fabricated once)

These were real fabrications called out in prior audits; this test pass **verifies
they are fixed** (see linked tests). If any still fakes data → **Fail**:

| Item | Old behaviour | Verify in |
|------|---------------|-----------|
| Customers `/users` PII/tier/risk | Hardcoded fakes | O-18 |
| Compliance cases | 4 demo seeds + synthesized PII | O-19 |
| Audit log | 5 demo seeds | O-21 |
| API keys | 2 demo seeds + **plaintext on list** | O-22 |
| Webhook deliveries | Hardcoded 3-item mock | O-25 |
| Aggregator registry | Seeds `globex` + `acme` | FAIL-SEED-AGG |
| Aggregator FX | Hardcoded `FX_RATE_INR_USDC` (~88.5) | note during C-30/C-50 |
